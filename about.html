                        Hello, I am Noran Borg and I am a graphic designer based in Malta. I
                        am studying for a degree for the passion I have which is graphic
                        design. I like visualising ideas and communicating with people
                        through design, this is what makes graphic design valuable for me.
                        Passion. The coursework I have when studying graphic design has
                        equipped me with technical skills and is encouraging me to design
                        with creativity more. I have always had a love for the creative
                        industry, especially paths requiring art and design skills. This
                        summer I got the opportunity to have an apprenticeship as a graphic
                        designer and this opportunity expanded my skills in using the Adobe
                        Creative Cloud and in creativity. My goal is to become a
                        professional graphic designer and I hope to create designs that
                        would travel the world. Other than design I love photography and
                        videography, I like creating social content. Feel free to reach me
                        out on my Instagram page @<b>ezz.creatives</b> or by email:
                        <b> noon.borg@email.com.</b>

                    <p>
                        I hope that u enjoyed exploring my design work, Thank you for your
                        time.
